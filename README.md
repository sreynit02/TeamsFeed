## Problem statement:  
For over 50 years, FeedingKY has not collected enough detailed information from farmers, especially about their main crops. Feeding KY needs to reformat its existing database to track farmers' and growers' information.  

## Goal
Our goal is to create a database that can effectively use queries to give the user data about farmers, crops, and where the crops go.

## Business Rule 
1. A farm can only be assigned to one county. 
2. A grower must own at least one farm . A farm must have one or more growers
3. A farmer must be a resident of Kentucky
4. A farmer can grow one or many crops
5. A farmer can donate up to 28 kinds of crops that are in the list of crops accepted by FeedingKY (they can accept other crops except berries and honey)
6. A farmer can have more than one invoice
7. Each grower is assigned an ID number 
8. Farmerâ€™s first/last name is recorded, their county, and address
9. Each invoice is assigned an ID
10. A farmer can sell their produce to FeedingKY at an auction or a food bank
11. There is only one food bank per county, but not all counties in KY have a food bank
12. A farmer can donate to KY Kids eat or not
13. Food has name and type.
